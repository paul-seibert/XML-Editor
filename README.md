# XML Metadata Editor For ArcGIS
This project was created with the original intent to change the metadata for a set of GIS grid files for use in ArcGIS. It may be adapted to automate editing other types of files in the future. Also of note, this is my first Github repository, so I am not sure how all of this works yet. 

## Pre-requisites
    - Files to edit must be downloaded to local drive and stored where appropriate
    - Python must be up to date
    - 'Original' directory must be a newly created folder, with no files stored inside

## Where to find input data

The GIS grid data originally used for this project can be downloaded at [NOAA's GIS Grids website](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_gis.html). The data that this project is concerned with is XML metadata files. Though, a few lines of code may be used to apply this editor to other file formats. 

## Why this editor is significant

This editor allows the user to automatically extract, edit, and replace a set of files instead of manually editing each one.

## Future applications 

In the future I may adapt this code to edit HTML, XML, or text files.
